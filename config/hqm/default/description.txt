Hello and welcome, I am IMPA, or, to be more precise, Intelligent Multi-Purpose Assistant, I am here to aid and guide you in surviving on this hot, dusty planet. The good news is that you seem to have survived the crash landing fine. The bad news is that shuttle most definitely did not. You are stuck here for the forseeable future. Speaking of which, you might want to get started setting up camp. Gather what supplies are left in the wreck, and then see about fiding water. It is mighty dry out here.
